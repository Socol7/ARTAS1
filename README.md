ARTAS1 — Art Academy Silva Landing Page I am an artist and an aspiring web developer, currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails. In addition to my artistic work, I also work remotely on web-related projects. This landing page is my first public project that combines my original illustrations with front-end development. A minimal, visual landing page for Art Academy Silva, featuring my original digital illustrations.   This is the first public version of the project and will be expanded with a gallery section and additional interactive elements.
